# Filtering

A lot of image processing algorithms rely on the convolution between a kernel (typicaly a 3x3 or 5x5 matrix) and an image. This may sound scary to some of you but that's not as difficult as it sounds:

Let's take a 3x3 matrix as our kernel. For each pixel, the filter multiplies the current pixel value and the other 8 surrounding pixels by the kernel corresponding value. Then it adds the result to get the value of the current pixel. Let's see an example:

In this example, the value of each pixel is equal to the double of the pixel that was located above it (e.g. 92 = 46 x 2).

# Blur

A simple blur can be done using this kernel: 

```math
\frac{1}{9}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
```


This is called the Box Blur. Each pixel is computed as the average of the surrounding pixels.

And here is the kernel for the Gaussian Blur:

```math
\frac{1}{256}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &  4 &  6 &  4 & 1 \\
4 & 16 & 24 & 16 & 4 \\
6 & 24 & 36 & 24 & 6 \\
4 & 16 & 24 & 16 & 4 \\
1 &  4 &  6 &  4 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
```
As you can see, it's a weighted mean of the surrounding pixels that gives more weight to the pixel near the current pixel.

# Edge detection

There are multiple ways to do edge detection. We will present the Sobel Operator here.

The Sobel Operator uses two kernels (one for each direction): $`
K_x =
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 1 \\
-2 & 0 & 2 \\
-1 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
`$ and $`
K_y =
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & -2 & -1 \\
 0 &  0 &  0 \\
 1 &  2 &  1
\end{bmatrix}
`$.

We compute the convolution between the image (converted in black and white) and the two kernels separately. That gives us, for each pixel, the values $`mag_x`$ and $`mag_y`$. The value of the current pixel is set at $`\sqrt{mag_x^2 + mag_y^2}`$.
